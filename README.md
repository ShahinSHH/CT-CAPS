# CT-CAPS
<h4>Feature Extraction-Based Automated Framework For COVID-19 Disease Identification From Chest CT Scans Using Capsule Networks.</h4>

CT-CAPS is a Capsule Network-based feature extractor developed to detect specific characteristics of CT slices, followed by a Max Pooling Layer to convert slice-level feature maps into patientlevel ones. Finally, a stack of fully connected layers are added to make the final decision. The CT-CAPS is trained on a dataset of CT slices labeled by three experienced radiologists to determine slices demonstrating infection and slices without an evidence of infection. CT-CAPS framework benefits from a fast and timely labeling process, which is highly valuable when we are facing an early emergence of a new type of data.
